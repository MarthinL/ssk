<BOLD><h2>Concept: Target Domain: BIGINT DBID</h2>
<p class="textfield" id="creator"><B>Creator</B>Marthin Laubscher</p>
<p class="textfield" id="description"><B>Description </B></p>In the original requirement the IDs are all BIGINT values, which would require a bijunction capable of storing 2^64 membership decisions would theoretically be required as the superset is all 2^64 BIGINT values. 
<br>
<br>
<br>However, database tables have reasonable limits restricting the actual number of rows and therefore primary keys that can appear in a table at any given point. Limiting the effective superset for which we need to indentify subsets to those, makes a big difference to the viability of SSK. We'd still need the full range of identifiers, but the natural limitation on cardinality of the superset caps the cardinality of the subset as well, which guarantees a level of sparsity we can depend on. 
<br>
<br>The SSK concept deos not do unbounded compression or other magic, it makes optimal use of implied constraints and the opportunities those create. <br>
