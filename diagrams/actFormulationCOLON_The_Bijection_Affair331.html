<BOLD><h2>Activity: Formulation: The Bijection Affair</h2>
<p class="textfield" id="creator"><B>Creator</B>Marthin Laubscher</p>
<p class="textfield" id="description"><B>Description </B></p>In The Bijection Affair, we recognise both SQL its profound influence in the database domain, and RDM for outlining a powerful theory despite getting hamstrung by the technology at the time it yielded SQL.
<br>
<br>But the past is no place to get trapped. Prior art, and technological advances, helped us leverage new insights into: 
<br>- set and bit vectors representing sets, later updated as bijection, from Knuth, 
<br>- bijection, a refinement of one-to-one and onto, from Bourbaki, 
<br>- data generation language principles, from Kolmogorov,
<br>- combinadics, a second bijection, from McCaffrey, and
<br>- 64-bit processors as norm
<br>to formulate SubSet Key (SSK) as a scalar value which bijects a subset of IDs of a table onto its own unique identifier.
<br>
<br>Beyond the immediate value to its donor project, SSK paves the way to completing what RDM promised, without disrupting SQL compatibility.<br>
