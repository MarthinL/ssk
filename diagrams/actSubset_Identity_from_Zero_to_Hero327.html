<BOLD><h2>Activity: Subset Identity from Zero to Hero</h2>
<p class="textfield" id="creator"><B>Creator</B>Marthin Laubscher</p>
<p class="textfield" id="description"><B>Description </B></p>For 50 years, SQL transformed how the world stores data. Yet in the symbolic world of relational theory, sets are not persisted as data�they live fleeting lives, conjured through mathematical notation.
<br>Mapping abstract theory to storage was profound. When it came to relationships between sets, both formally and informally, "Parent's Children" and "Children of Parent" are equivalent. SQL picked the latter as its storage paradigm.
<br>
<br>SSK stems from exploring the former�the other side of that equivalence�as an equally valid alternative. Not a replacement, but a paradigm that could coexist with traditional approaches, even be internalised in SQL, retaining foreign key semantics while implementing storage as the inverse when beneficial.
<br>
<br>That exploration yielded SubSet Key: a way to store subsets as scalar values with self-contained identity. The identity is bijection�a concept proven invaluable in its original setting, and recognised for the opportunities it creates in databases.
<br>
<br>This project is dedicated to realising those opportunities for everyone with a stake in data.<br>
