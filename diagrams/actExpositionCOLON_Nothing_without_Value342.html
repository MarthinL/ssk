<br>
<br>SSK already provides value to its donor project, but only in a niche capacity�an injustice, given how much more it has to offer the entire database value chain and its stakeholders. None of whom would have encountered anything like it.
<br>
<br>Giving a subset a bijective identity that fits in a scalar value is such an outlandish concept that the only way anyone can grasp it is to see it in action.
<br>
<br>In the Nothing without Value concern, we capture selected rows into SSKs, store those values, combine them in different ways, and use the results to apply complex filters to tables without reprocessing the data. We treat subsets as scalar data: grouping them, aggregating them, converting to and from other types including SETOF BIGINT tables. We raise questions for the curious to play with.
<br>
<br>All without caring about the underlying technology, because the semantics of SSK stay exactly the same whether the domain is 1..64 or 1..2^64. The domain is implementation detail�crucial if value is to reach beyond the trivial�but the semantics are fixed.
