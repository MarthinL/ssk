# SSK IDEF0 Models

This directory contains the formal IDEF0 (Integration Definition for Function Modeling) models that describe SSK's architecture using structured concern decomposition.

## Files

### Formal IDEF0 Reports (Ai0Win Tool Output)

- **IMPLEMENTATION_CONCERNS.RTF**: Complete IDEF0 report for the Implementation Concerns model (IMP), exported from Ai0Win IDEF0 modeling tool. This is the authoritative source showing the technical decomposition of the SSK PostgreSQL extension into Value Decoder, Function Processor, and Value Encoder concerns with all boundary and internal concepts documented.

- **SSK_CONCERNS.TXT**: Text export of the Project Concerns IDEF0 model (PRJ), showing the strategic decomposition from project formulation through exposition, implementation, expansion, and vitalisation. Generated by Ai0Win in neutral text format.

### Human-Readable Model Documentation

- **SSK_CONCERNS_MODEL.md**: Markdown documentation of the core SSK concerns using IDEF0/ICOM (Inputs, Controls, Outputs, Mechanisms) framework. Describes the four fundamental concerns: Representation Layer, Encoding Layer, Persistence Layer, and Query Layer.

- **IDEF0_MODEL_RECONSTRUCTION_21DEC2025.md**: Detailed reconstruction of the SSK IDEF0 models from multiple source formats (TXT, IDL, XML, CSV). Documents the 4-level diagram hierarchy from context (A-0) through BIGINT domain implementation (A31).

## Understanding IDEF0

IDEF0 is a function modeling methodology that describes systems through hierarchical decomposition of activities/concerns. Key principles:

- **Parallel, Reactive System**: All activities exist in parallel, always. An activity is inactive until ALL requisite inputs, controls, and mechanisms are simultaneously present; at that instant, the output is generated. This is NOT sequential flow.

- **ICOM Framework**: Each activity is defined by:
  - **Inputs**: Data consumed/transformed
  - **Controls**: Constraints governing the transformation
  - **Outputs**: Results produced
  - **Mechanisms**: Resources enabling the transformation

- **Hierarchical Decomposition**: Complex activities break down into simpler sub-activities, maintaining ICOM relationships at each level.

## Relationship to Other Documentation

These formal models are the authoritative source for SSK's architecture. They are referenced by:

- **[PROJECT_CONCERNS.md](../PROJECT_CONCERNS.md)**: Markdown presentation of the strategic (PRJ) model
- **[IMPLEMENTATION_CONCERNS.md](../IMPLEMENTATION_CONCERNS.md)**: Markdown presentation of the technical (IMP) model  
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md)**: Integration guide bridging both models for contributors

The RTF and TXT files are direct exports from professional IDEF0 modeling tools and serve as the canonical reference. The markdown documents make this content accessible on GitHub.

## For Contributors

When working on SSK:

1. **Start with the concern models** to understand where your work fits in the architecture
2. **Reference the formal reports** (RTF/TXT) for authoritative definitions of concepts and relationships
3. **Use the markdown documents** for quick navigation and GitHub-friendly reading
4. **Consult ARCHITECTURE.md** for practical integration guidance and source code mapping

## Viewing RTF Files

The IMPLEMENTATION_CONCERNS.RTF file can be opened with:
- Microsoft Word
- LibreOffice Writer  
- macOS TextEdit (File → Open, select RTF)
- Any RTF-compatible viewer

The file contains embedded diagrams (WMF format) showing the IDEF0 activity decompositions.
